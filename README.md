# 4_Pandas_proect

This project reviews student and school data from a district and does a variety of analyses in order to look for trends and patterns when considering a variety of factors in relation to school performance. Some of the factors considered were school size, school type (District vs. Charter), and School spending (per studnet). 

Code Sources
- 
In cell 11 of my project (code listed below), I received support in the syntax from a Learning Assistant in order to pull the school name and school type into a pandas series object to later include in a larger dataframe. 
Cell 11: 
(school_types = school_data.set_index("school_name")["type"])
